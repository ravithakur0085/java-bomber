			<b>>What is java?</b>
			<p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high
				level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language. Java
				was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of
				Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of
				Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a
				registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name
				from Oak to Java.</p>
			<b>Platform:</b>
			<p>Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs,
				is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE)
				and API, it is called a platform.</p>

				The complete History of Java Programming Language<br> Java is
				an Object-Oriented programming language developed by James Gosling
				in the early 1990s. The team initiated this project to develop a
				language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, television, etc.
				Originally C++ was considered to be used in the project but the idea
				was rejected for several reasons(For instance C++ required more
				memory). Gosling endeavoured to alter and expand C++ however before
				long surrendered that for making another stage called Green. James
				Gosling and his team called their project Greentalk and its file
				extension was and later became to known as OAK. Why Oak? The name
				Oak was used by Gosling after an oak tree that remained outside his
				office. Also, Oak is an image of solidarity and picked as a national
				tree of numerous nations like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania,
				etc. But they had to later rename it as JAVA as it was already a
				trademark by Oak Technologies. JAVA Gosling and his team did a
				brainstorm session and after the session, they came up with several
				names such as JAVA, DNA, SILK, RUBY, etc. Java name was decided
				after much discussion since it was so unique. The name Java
				originates from a sort of espresso bean, Java. Gosling came up with
				this name while having a coffee near his office. Java was created on
				the principles like Robust, Portable, Platform Independent, High
				Performance, Multithread, etc. and was called one of the Ten Best
				Products of 1995 by the TIME MAGAZINE. Currently, Java is used in
				internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions,
				etc. The Java language has experienced a few changes since JDK 1.0
				just as various augmentations of classes and packages to the
				standard library. In Addition to the language changes, considerably
				more sensational changes have been made to the Java Class Library
				throughout the years, which has developed from a couple of hundred
				classes in JDK 1.0 to more than three thousand in J2SE 5.

			<b>>Java Example :</b>
			<p>Let's have a quick look at Java programming example. A
				detailed description of Hello Java example is available in next
				page.</p>
			<strong>Simple.java</strong>
			<pre style="font-size: 15px;">
class Simple{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
	System.out.println("Hello Java");  
	}  
}

			<b>>Application :</b>
			<p>According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many
				devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:</p>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media
						player, antivirus, etc.</p></li>
				<li><p>Web Applications such as irctc.co.in,
						javatpoint.com, etc.</p></li>
				<li><p>Enterprise Applications such as banking
						applications.</p></li>
				<li><p>Mobile</p></li>
				<li><p>Embedded System</p></li>
				<li><p>Smart Card</p></li>
				<li><p>Robotics</p></li>
				<li><p>Games, etc.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<br> <b>>Types of Java Application :</b>
			<p>There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created
				using Java programming:</p>
			<br> <strong>1) Standalone Application</strong> <br>
			<p>Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications
				or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we
				need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application
				are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for
				creating standalone applications.</p>
			<br> <strong>2) Web Application</strong> <br>
			<p>
				An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic
				page is called a web application. Currently, <u>Servlet, JSP,
					Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF,</u> etc. technologies are used for
				creating web applications in Java.
			</p>
			<br> <strong>3) Enterprise Application</strong>
			<p>
				An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking
				applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has
				advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering.
				In Java,<u> EJB</u> is used for creating enterprise applications.
			</p>
			<br> <strong>4) Mobile Application </strong>
			<p>An application which is created for mobile devices is called a
				mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for
				creating mobile applications.</p>




			<br> <br> <b>>Java Platforms / Editions:</b> <br>
			<p>There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:</p>
			<br> <strong>1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)</strong>
			<p>It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java
				programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util,
				java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String,
				Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream,
				Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.</p>
			<br> <strong>2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)</strong>
			<p>It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop
				web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE
				platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB,
				JPA, etc.</p>
			<br> <strong>3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)</strong>
			<p>It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile
				applications.</p>
			<br> <strong>4) JavaFX</strong>
			<p>It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a
				lightweight user interface API.</p>
			<br> <br> <b>Prerequisite:</b> <br> <br>
			<p>To learn Java, you must have the basic knowledge of C/C++
				programming language.</p>
